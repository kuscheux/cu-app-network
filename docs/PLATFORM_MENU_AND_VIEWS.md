# Platform: Left menu options and content views (everything unlocked)

No login gate — all views are available as soon as a credit union is selected.

---

## Sidebar behavior

- **Collapse toggle** is at the **top** of the left menu (first row when expanded).
- **Hover to expand:** When the sidebar is collapsed, hovering over it expands it temporarily; moving the mouse away collapses it again.
- **Collapse** = narrow icon strip. **Expand** = full sidebar with labels + CU dropdown.
